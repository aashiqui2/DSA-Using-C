# Graph
 * Newtork of nodes
    NODE -VERTICES oR VERTEX
    Connetion is nothing but edges
# Application of Graph
 * MAps
 * social network
 * delivery network

# Edge and Direction
 * uni-directional  x ---> y
 * bi-directional / unidirectional  x<---->y ,x-----y
 * directed graph and undirected graph
# Edge and Weight
 * Weigted x---->y(10), x----y(10)
 * unweighted x--->y ,x---y 

# Stroring a graph
 Adjacent List -> List of List
 Adjacency list
 Edge List
 2d matrix(Implicit graph)
