Here's a table highlighting the differences between singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, and doubly circular linked lists:

| Feature                        | Singly Linked List                          | Doubly Linked List                          | Circular Linked List                         | Doubly Circular Linked List                  |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Node Structure**             | Data and a single pointer to the next node | Data and two pointers (next and previous)  | Data and a single pointer to the next node | Data and two pointers (next and previous)  |
| **Traversal**                  | Forward only                                | Forward and backward                        | Forward in a circular manner                | Forward and backward in a circular manner   |
| **Head and Tail Relationship** | Head points to the first node               | Head points to the first node               | Tail's next pointer points to the head      | Tail's next pointer points to the head, and head's previous pointer points to the tail |
| **Memory Usage**               | Less (single pointer per node)              | More (two pointers per node)                | Less (single pointer per node)              | More (two pointers per node)                |
| **Insertion Complexity**       | O(1) at the beginning, O(n) at the end      | O(1) at the beginning, O(n) at the end      | O(1) at the beginning, O(n) at the end      | O(1) at the beginning, O(n) at the end      |
| **Deletion Complexity**        | O(1) at the beginning, O(n) at the end      | O(1) at the beginning, O(n) at the end      | O(1) at the beginning, O(n) at the end      | O(1) at the beginning, O(n) at the end      |
| **Circular Nature**            | No                                          | No                                          | Yes                                         | Yes                                         |
| **Use Cases**                  | Simple list operations, stack               | Doubly ended operations, deque              | Round-robin scheduling, circular buffering  | Bidirectional circular list operations      |

### Summary

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node, traversal is only in one direction.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.
- **Circular Linked List**: Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node points back to the head, forming a circle.
- **Doubly Circular Linked List**: Combines the features of doubly linked lists and circular linked lists, with nodes having pointers to both next and previous nodes, and the list forming a circle.
