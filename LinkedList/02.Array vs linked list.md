1) cast of accessing an element
array-o(1)
linkedlist-o(n)
2) Memory requirement and utilization
3) cost of insertion and deletion
   ### Array
   a) at beginning -O(n)
   b) at end -O(1)
   c) at ith position -O(n)
   ### Linked list
   a) at beginning -O(1)
   b) at end -O(n)
   c) at ith position -O(n) 

   # Array
   * array is easy to use 
   * binary ad linear search is possible
   # Linked list
   * only linear search is possible

# Difference on array and linkedlist

| Aspect                | Linked List                                      | Array                                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory Usage**      | Dynamic memory allocation; can grow/shrink easily | Fixed size (in static arrays); dynamic arrays can resize but may involve copying data |
| **Insertion**         | O(1) time for insertion at the beginning or middle if the position is known | O(1) time for adding at the end (amortized for dynamic arrays); O(n) for insertion in the middle or beginning |
| **Deletion**          | O(1) time if the node to be deleted is known     | O(n) for deletion and shifting elements in the case of static arrays |
| **Access Time**       | O(n) for accessing elements                      | O(1) for accessing any element via index           |
| **Memory Overhead**   | Extra memory for storing pointers (next/prev)    | No extra memory for element storage, only data     |
| **Cache Performance** | Poor due to non-contiguous memory allocation     | Good due to contiguous memory allocation           |
| **Complexity of Implementation** | More complex due to pointer management     | Simple and straightforward                          |
| **Resizing**          | Easy and efficient; just adjust pointers         | Expensive for static arrays (create new array and copy elements); moderate for dynamic arrays (amortized resizing) |
| **Iteration**         | Slower due to pointer traversal                  | Faster due to contiguous memory and direct index access |
| **Memory Wastage**    | No memory wastage (except for pointers)          | Potential for wasted memory if array is not fully utilized (over-provisioning) |
| **Binary Search**     | Not possible efficiently (O(n))                  | Possible (O(log n)) if array is sorted             |
