To find the closest pair of points using a brute force approach in C, you can follow this approach:

1. **Calculate the distance between every pair of points**.
2. **Track the minimum distance encountered**.

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <float.h>
#include <math.h>

// Structure to represent a point
typedef struct {
    float x, y;
} Point;

// Function to calculate the distance between two points
float distance(Point p1, Point p2) {
    return sqrtf((p1.x - p2.x) * (p1.x - p2.x) + (p1.y - p2.y) * (p1.y - p2.y));
}

// Function to find the closest pair of points using brute force
void closestPair(Point points[], int n) {
    if (n < 2) {
        printf("Not enough points to determine a closest pair.\n");
        return;
    }

    float minDist = FLT_MAX;
    int p1 = 0, p2 = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            float dist = distance(points[i], points[j]);
            if (dist < minDist) {
                minDist = dist;
                p1 = i;
                p2 = j;
            }
        }
    }

    printf("The closest pair is between points (%f, %f) and (%f, %f) with distance %f\n",
           points[p1].x, points[p1].y, points[p2].x, points[p2].y, minDist);
}

int main() {
    Point points[] = {{0, 0}, {1, 1}, {3, 4}, {5, 1}};
    int n = sizeof(points) / sizeof(points[0]);

    closestPair(points, n);

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this brute force approach is \(O(n^2)\) because you need to compare each pair of points, and there are \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) pairs.

### Comparison Complexity

In terms of comparison operations, you perform \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) comparisons of distances, as each pair of points is compared once. Thus, the comparison complexity is also \(O(n^2)\).
