Yes, the size of the **output array** is the same as the size of the **input array** because we are sorting all elements of the original array. The **output array** has space for all elements, and its size matches the size of the original input array.

For example:

- **Input array**:
  ```
  arr[] = {15, 1, 321, 10, 802, 2, 123, 90, 109, 11}
  ```
  This array has 10 elements, so the **output array** must also have 10 elements.

### Clarifying the "Position" Concept:

The **positions** refer to the **indices in the output array** where each element from the input array should be placed based on the cumulative count. The cumulative count helps us determine where (in terms of index) each element should go.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's go through the process using an **empty output array** of size 10:

1. **Create an output array** of the same size as the input array:
   ```
   output[] = {_, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _}  // Initially empty
   ```

2. **Place elements based on cumulative count**:
   We will place each element from the input array into the `output[]` array, starting from the rightmost element (this ensures the sort is stable). As we place each element, we use the **cumulative count array** to determine the index (position) for that element.

#### Detailed Steps:

- **Element `15`**:
  - Ones digit is `5`.
  - Cumulative count tells us that `count[5] = 9`, meaning the element `15` should go into **position 8** in the `output[]` array.
  - Place `15` in **index 8** of the output array:
    ```
    output[] = {_, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, 15, _}
    ```
  - Decrement `count[5]` by 1, so `count[5]` becomes `8`.

- **Element `1`**:
  - Ones digit is `1`.
  - Cumulative count tells us that `count[1] = 5`, meaning `1` should go into **position 4** in the `output[]` array.
  - Place `1` in **index 4** of the output array:
    ```
    output[] = {_, _, _, _, 1, _, _, _, 15, _}
    ```
  - Decrement `count[1]` by 1, so `count[1]` becomes `4`.

- **Element `321`**:
  - Ones digit is `1`.
  - Cumulative count tells us that `count[1] = 4`, meaning `321` should go into **position 3**.
  - Place `321` in **index 3**:
    ```
    output[] = {_, _, _, 321, 1, _, _, _, 15, _}
    ```
  - Decrement `count[1]` by 1, so `count[1]` becomes `3`.

- **Element `10`**:
  - Ones digit is `0`.
  - Cumulative count tells us that `count[0] = 2`, meaning `10` should go into **position 1**.
  - Place `10` in **index 1**:
    ```
    output[] = {_, 10, _, 321, 1, _, _, _, 15, _}
    ```
  - Decrement `count[0]` by 1, so `count[0]` becomes `1`.

- **Element `802`**:
  - Ones digit is `2`.
  - Cumulative count tells us that `count[2] = 7`, meaning `802` should go into **position 6**.
  - Place `802` in **index 6**:
    ```
    output[] = {_, 10, _, 321, 1, _, 802, _, 15, _}
    ```
  - Decrement `count[2]` by 1, so `count[2]` becomes `6`.

- **Element `2`**:
  - Ones digit is `2`.
  - Cumulative count tells us that `count[2] = 6`, meaning `2` should go into **position 5**.
  - Place `2` in **index 5**:
    ```
    output[] = {_, 10, _, 321, 1, 2, 802, _, 15, _}
    ```
  - Decrement `count[2]` by 1, so `count[2]` becomes `5`.

- **Element `123`**:
  - Ones digit is `3`.
  - Cumulative count tells us that `count[3] = 8`, meaning `123` should go into **position 7**.
  - Place `123` in **index 7**:
    ```
    output[] = {_, 10, _, 321, 1, 2, 802, 123, 15, _}
    ```
  - Decrement `count[3]` by 1, so `count[3]` becomes `7`.

- **Element `90`**:
  - Ones digit is `0`.
  - Cumulative count tells us that `count[0] = 1`, meaning `90` should go into **position 0**.
  - Place `90` in **index 0**:
    ```
    output[] = {90, 10, _, 321, 1, 2, 802, 123, 15, _}
    ```
  - Decrement `count[0]` by 1, so `count[0]` becomes `0`.

- **Element `109`**:
  - Ones digit is `9`.
  - Cumulative count tells us that `count[9] = 10`, meaning `109` should go into **position 9**.
  - Place `109` in **index 9**:
    ```
    output[] = {90, 10, _, 321, 1, 2, 802, 123, 15, 109}
    ```
  - Decrement `count[9]` by 1, so `count[9]` becomes `9`.

- **Element `11`**:
  - Ones digit is `1`.
  - Cumulative count tells us that `count[1] = 3`, meaning `11` should go into **position 2**.
  - Place `11` in **index 2**:
    ```
    output[] = {90, 10, 11, 321, 1, 2, 802, 123, 15, 109}
    ```
  - Decrement `count[1]` by 1, so `count[1]` becomes `2`.

### Final **Output Array**:
After placing all elements in their correct positions, the output array becomes:
```
output[] = {90, 10, 11, 321, 1, 2, 802, 123, 15, 109}
```

So, when I say **position**, I mean the **index** in this final output array where the element should be placed.
