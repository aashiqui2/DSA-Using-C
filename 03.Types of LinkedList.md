# Types of Linkedlist
| Type                  | Description                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Singly Linked List**| Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. Traversal is unidirectional (forward only). |
| **Doubly Linked List**| Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node. Traversal can be bidirectional. |
| **Circular Linked List** | Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. Can also be doubly circular if each node points to both its next and previous nodes. |
| **Singly Circular Linked List** | Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node points to the first node, forming a circular structure. Traversal is unidirectional. |
| **Doubly Circular Linked List** | Each node contains pointers to both the next and previous nodes, with the last node pointing back to the first node, forming a circular structure. Traversal can be bidirectional. |

### Details

1. **Singly Linked List**:
   - **Structure**: Node contains data and a single pointer to the next node.
   - **Pros**: Simple implementation, efficient insertion and deletion from the list.
   - **Cons**: Only supports traversal in one direction, no way to go backward.

2. **Doubly Linked List**:
   - **Structure**: Node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
   - **Pros**: Supports bidirectional traversal, easier to delete a node from the middle of the list.
   - **Cons**: More memory overhead due to the extra pointer, more complex implementation.

3. **Circular Linked List**:
   - **Structure**: Last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
   - **Pros**: Can traverse the entire list starting from any node, no need to check for the end of the list.
   - **Cons**: More complex traversal logic, potential for infinite loops if not careful.

4. **Singly Circular Linked List**:
   - **Structure**: Similar to a singly linked list, but the last node points to the first node.
   - **Pros**: Efficient for implementing circular buffers or queues.
   - **Cons**: Traversal is only in one direction, more complex logic for operations.

5. **Doubly Circular Linked List**:
   - **Structure**: Similar to a doubly linked list, but the last node points to the first node, and the first node points to the last node.
   - **Pros**: Supports bidirectional traversal, no need to check for the end of the list.
   - **Cons**: More memory overhead, complex implementation and traversal logic.
